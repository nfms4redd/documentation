Getting involved
=================

For any doubt or problem related to the usage or configuration of the platform it is possible to get help on the following forums:

* Spanish: https://groups.google.com/group/nfms4redd-usuarios

* English: https://groups.google.com/group/nfms4redd-users

Reporting bugs
--------------

It is also possible to request new features and report bugs in the issue tracker. An issue tracker provides a centralized way to manage the requests for fixes and new functionalities on the portal. Associated with each feature request there is a space for communication and discussion so it is an interesting tool for collaboration and finding common interests in the context of the system.

Feature requests can eventually be developed if decided by the development team. On the other side, if the feature is not seen as interesting in the discussion it may be closed. For having one of these outcomes, every functionality must be evaluated technically in terms of cost of development and maintenance and in terms of convenience related to the general objectives of the project.

In our case the feature request of the NFMS portal can be found here:

* https://github.com/nfms4redd/nfms/issues.

The way to start a discussion to include a new functionality is to create an issue. If the issue is already created, it is possible to add new comments asking for the functionality or the bug fix to be included in the next release.

Following and participating in the development
------------------------------------------------

In order to follow the activity of these issues it is necessary to register in this forum, where all the relevant exchanges related to the development process take place:

* https://groups.google.com/group/nfms4redd-admin

In this last forum, there are regular calls for planning where the issues are scheduled for the next version and where it is possible to participate just by sending any message. Any constructive contribution is welcome.
